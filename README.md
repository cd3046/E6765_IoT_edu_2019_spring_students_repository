# E6765_IoT_edu_2019_spring_repository    (from E6765_IoT_edu_2018Summer_repository)

## TODO 

* Sync two versions of this wiki - student and instructors  https://github.com/zk2172-columbia/E6765_IoT_edu_2019_spring_students_repository   and    https://github.com/zk2172-columbia/E6765_IoT_edu_2018Summer_repository

* Wiced Sense - potential details instructions on cypress development threads - investigate: https://community.cypress.com/thread/45780

* The sidebars are not good - need to be fixed - that may require changing the names of wiki pages -
